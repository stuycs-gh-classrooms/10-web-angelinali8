<h2> Categorizing Boba </h2>




Bases
The tea base for boba drinks is usually black or green tea and can be customized with an array of syrups like peach, strawberry, and lychee. Milk can also be added to teas, transforming them to milk teas, and making for a much creamier, indulgent drink. The classic “boba milk tea” order is a black tea with milk and boba.

Some drinks, however, stray away from the conventional green and black tea base. Taro milk tea, another popular choice, is made from the tropical taro root. Refreshing fruit teas, often with fresh fruit slices mixed right in, are usually available and often caffeine-free. Bright orange Thai tea also makes an appearance on most boba menus, and coffee milk tea is a choice for coffee enthusiasts who want the best of both worlds. There are also oolong, matcha, and white teas to pick from.

Beyond teas, most boba shops also have slushies and milk drinks available too. Slushies are typically made from tea and syrups that are thrown in a blender with crushed ice, resulting in a sweet and frosty treat. Milk drinks have milk as a base and are usually sweetened with honey or brown sugar syrup—which might not sit will for those who are lactose-intolerant.

That being said, lots of boba shops offer milk alternatives—like soy, almond, lactose-free milk, and even oat milk—which nicely accommodates the “30 million to 50 million Americans [who] are lactose intolerant.”

Half the fun of going out for a boba, which is both a beverage and a snack rolled in one, is customizing it perfectly to your tastes. Almost all boba shops give you the option to adjust the sweetness of your drink, change how much ice you want, and even have hot and cold options (for when you need your boba fix but it’s freezing outside).

Toppings (maybe the most important part)
Boba
This is the quintessential topping at any tea parlor. Once these balls of cassava root are rolled into bite size bunches, they’re boiled and flavored, often with brown sugar or honey. The result is a subtly sweet, chewy addition to your drink that increases the fun of having a milk tea tenfold. If you’re trying milk tea for the first time, I’d definitely recommend going classic and adding boba to your drink.

Pudding
This is not to be confused with snack pack-style pudding. Pudding at boba shops are custard-like in flavor—made from egg yolks, cream, and sugar—but firmer due to the addition of gelatin. The closest thing I could compare it to is a very soft flan. They have the slightest chew and pair really nicely with creamier, more indulgent milk teas. Sometimes, boba shops will also have flavored puddings, like taro or mango pudding. Customize your drink to your preference, or even add pudding on top of boba for different textures!

Grass jelly
Don’t worry—it tastes nothing like grass (nor is it made from grass). The treat is made from Chinese mesona, a plant that is part of the mint family. The jelly is usually steeped in brown sugar for a slightly sweet, herbaceous taste. Grass jelly comes cut in cubes and texturally is firmer than pudding. I’d recommend pairing grass jelly with any milk tea, as it makes the perfect substitute for boba if you’re feeling experimental. It also goes well with coffee-based drinks.

Aloe Vera
Aloe vera is rich in antioxidants and said to be beneficial for your skin, so why not add it to your drink order? These clear, cubed jellies are soaked in a syrup and taste refreshing and sweet. Because the flavor is a bit subdued, aloe vera jelly goes nicely with bolder, tropical flavors. I’d recommend adding it to citrus drinks, like an orange or passion fruit green tea.

Sago/tapioca
Sago tastes like tapioca pudding without any of the pudding. The texture is chewy and spongy, but with much more give than a tapioca pearl. These delicate, mini pearls makes appearances in many traditional Asian desserts, and pairs nicely with coconut, red bean, and matcha flavors. I suggest swapping them in for boba if you don’t want to chew your drink as much.

Taro balls
Unlike boba pearls, which have a springy texture that bounces back mid-chew, taro balls have a more gentle melt-in-your-mouth feel to them. These add-ons are made from taro, mashed with sweet potato or tapioca flour and water to form misshapen spheres of deliciousness. In Taiwan, taro balls are often eaten in a bowl as a dessert, both iced and hot. Add it to your taro milk tea for a double dose of taro, or pair it with oolong milk tea for a dessert-drink hybrid.

Red bean
If you think beans don’t belong in desserts or drinks, you are missing out on a delicious opportunity to get more fiber in your diet. Red bean (also commonly known as the azuki bean) is prepared by boiling the legume in sugar, resulting in a fragrant, soft mixture. Traditionally, red bean complements matcha, so I’d recommend having it in a matcha milk tea for an earthy drink.

Whipped foam/cream
Whipped foam toppings are a recent development in the world of boba milk teas. Ranging from tiramisu crema, to sea salt cream, these thick, glossy foams are gently layered on top of teas and sipped on delicately. There’s even “cheese tea,” which is whipped cheese powder or cream cheese that provides a salty balance to the syrupy sweet teas of boba shops. The texture is similar to a fluffy mousse and provides an awesome foam mustache when enjoyed correctly.

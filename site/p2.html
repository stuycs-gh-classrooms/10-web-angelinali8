<h2> Where to Start </h2>

<p>Boba shops are very common to come across in New York City and urban areas due to their popularity and the fun delicious addiction people have. Downtown Flushing has a ton of great affordable boba spots. If you live in a place with less/no boba cafes, or want to try boba without spending half of your 15 year old allowance (disclaimer, boba does get quite expensive without discounts), you can try making them yourself. They require easy to find pantry items such as milk, sugar, tea and starches. Toppings aside from the og tapioca pearls will most likely need a trip to the grocery store. Asian grocery stores usually have these toppings. You definitely don't have to be a handy kitchen wizard to whip up this fun drink, but if you're less inclinced to make boba, some (asian) grocery stores may have pre-packages mixes/drinks. You will be able to find some online as well. However, due to their preserved nature, they may not capture the full effect of this drink </p>

      Born and raised in the bustling and trendy metropolis of NYC, I've become quite familiar with boba, a.k.a. bubble tea. These delightful layered drinks are picture worthy and so complexly delishious. 
      Boba shops have popped up all throughout America (+ others!) and for those who havenâ€™t had the chance to experience the magic that is boba, and find themselves staring, perplexed, at the 
      overwhelming menu full of customizable options, this is Boba 101. This site will take you on a tour about <a href="p0.html">what boba is</a> and how you can <a href="p1.html">personalize</a> your 
      perfect cup. Dont know where to start after figuring out your entire order?! No worries! The last portion of this website will share some of <a href="p2.html">my own favorite</a> stores/chains as well as a few alternatives if boba is unavailable. Hope you have fun!

      <h1> So.. what is boba? Whats the hype? </h1>
      <p class="description">
       Boba is really just starch balls. What makes them so fun to eat is it's chewy texture, and the refreshing drink that accompanies it. Boba—the drink in its entirety—originates from Taiwan,  
       though its disputed which city and specific shop it actually started from. Originally, boba pearls were used in shaved ice desserts and paired with syrups, beans, and delectably chewy rice 
       balls. Milk tea was also consumed regularly and thankfully, someone decided to merge the two, thus creating the genius, beloved drink we now have today. Boba culture made its way to America 
       through Taiwanese neighborhoods and blossomed near college campuses and high schools, where students would gather for study groups. Most boba shops, even now, are open late and offer affordable 
       snacks and drinks, which make them the perfect stop for late-night hang outs and studying.
